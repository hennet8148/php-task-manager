# php-task-manager

This is a lightweight, single-user PHP tool built to track and manage **complex CAM task flows** involved in CNC guitar neck operations.

Originally developed for **Hard Times Guitar Company**, it was used to:

- Break down guitar neck builds into multiple CAM stages
- Track setup dependencies and operation sequences
- Capture progress notes across neck variants
- Keep CAM workflows organized and accessible during iteration

## ⚠️ Not a general-purpose tool

This app was built for **a very specific in-house use case** and is not intended for broad deployment. That said, it may serve as inspiration or scaffolding for others working on:

- Guitar or luthiery-related CAM workflows  
- CNC operation tracking systems  
- Lightweight PHP dashboard tools

## Status

This tool is not actively maintained, but I’m keeping it public for transparency and archival purposes.
